# What is that repo ?

It is just a personnal project to try to understand all the different parts of the job of a compiler.
The reason is when I read some articles about compiling, people use tools to do some part of the job (like Flex, Bison, LLVM).
Thing is that when you never put an hand on compilers, well ... it feels like black magic.
Here I just want to understand and play a bit with those stuffs. 

At the end I guess I will use tools to do some jobs in order to have a working compiler and why not having a kind of C language to generate SNES assembly code (seems crazy but why not, it's just for fun).
